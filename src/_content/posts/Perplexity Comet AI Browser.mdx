Perplexity has launched Comet, an AI-powered web browser that goes beyond traditional browsing by acting as a personal assistant capable of automating tasks, summarizing content, and performing actions across websites. According to TechCrunch, this innovative browser can open new tabs, find and apply promo codes, summarize YouTube videos at specific timestamps, and conduct research while users focus on other activities.

## Comet's Agentic Shopping Capabilities

Built on advanced agentic search technology, Comet transforms online shopping from a manual browsing experience into an intelligent, conversational workflow. The browser can execute complete purchasing workflows autonomously, from product research to checkout completion, while maintaining perfect context throughout the entire process. Users can simply ask Comet to "buy something you forgot" or compare products across multiple retailers, and the AI assistant handles the complex navigation and decision-making processes.

The shopping capabilities extend far beyond basic search and comparison functions. Comet can analyze product specifications, cross-reference reviews, apply promotional codes, and even manage shopping lists across different platforms. During testing, the browser successfully navigated complex e-commerce sites, checked items on Amazon, and completed purchase workflows with minimal user intervention. These agentic capabilities represent a fundamental shift from traditional e-commerce browsing, where users manually click through multiple pages and tabs, to a streamlined experience where the AI handles the entire shopping journey while users focus on making informed decisions.

## YouTube Video Timestamping Features

The browser's YouTube integration showcases sophisticated video analysis capabilities that transform how users consume long-form content. When viewing any YouTube video, Comet can automatically generate structured summaries with clickable timestamps that jump directly to specific sections, eliminating the need to manually scrub through lengthy content. This feature proves particularly valuable for educational videos, podcasts, and tutorials where users want to access specific information quickly.

Beyond basic summarization, the assistant can process multiple YouTube tabs simultaneously, analyzing content across different videos to provide comparative insights or comprehensive overviews of related topics. Users can ask Comet to review all open video tabs and extract key points from each, or even request summaries of videos watched in previous browsing sessions through the browser's history analysis feature. The AI reads video transcripts rather than watching the actual content, which means the feature works best with videos that have accurate closed captions or auto-generated subtitles available.

## Promo Code Auto-Application

The browser's promo code automation represents one of its most practical applications, eliminating the tedious process of manually searching and testing discount codes across multiple websites. Unlike traditional coupon-finding browser extensions that simply display codes, Comet actively tests each promotional offer directly in the shopping cart until it finds one that works. This capability extends to notoriously difficult-to-discount retailers where conventional coupon sites often fail to provide working codes.

The system operates by recognizing discount code form fields on e-commerce sites and systematically applying available promotions in real-time. During testing, Comet successfully found and applied working discount codes on challenging websites like Overstock, where it automatically entered codes, clicked apply buttons, and verified successful discounts before continuing to search for better offers. This automated testing eliminates the frustration of trying expired or invalid codes from questionable coupon websites, while users can continue browsing other tabs as the AI handles the discount optimization process in the background.
